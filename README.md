## Project Description:
This project is a real-time sampling studio where users can:
* Compose their own signal by adding multiple sinusoidals
* Remove one or more of the added signals
* Upload a signal file (.csv or .xlsx)
* Add noise to the signal and control the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
* Control the sampling frequency of the signal to see the effects of undersampling and oversampling (default sampling frequency is the Nyquist frequency)
